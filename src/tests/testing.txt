Instructions for testing:

1) create your test following a similar format to the example test. Your test
	will likely be more complex than the sample, as it was written quickly
	to provide an example.

2) add your test to the makefile.
	You should add the file that includes your test into the SRCS line as 
	well as any files that the test is dependent upon (a.k.a. the *.cpp file
	you're testing.

3) to run the entire test suite, run the command ./utest
