chapter 17 - pages 345, and 346 contain SQA Plan info.
 
CM Plan is being constructed by the Management Team.
 
We were given no template for the SQA plan and may not have the right format.
 
If you are not in the management team and did not work on the last SRS document version please work on a section of SQA.
 
Since we may not have the right idea, limit each section to no more than 2 sentences.
 
Put your name next to the section in the workspread if you work on the SQA plan.
 
See important links (in teams) for SQA Plan and Work Spread.

I want a name next to a field by 8:00 PM tomorrow, unless stated otherwise after this message.
